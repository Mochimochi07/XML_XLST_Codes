# XML_Codes

These are my XML codes.

XML files are not programming languages but it is kind of fun to make these things because it contains data.

XML is a fun language for data integration and data transfer with SOAP service, document formatting, web searching, layout creation and storing data configuration.

XML is a file format also used that in data science along with xlsx,json,csv,dat,mdb,sav,log,etc...
